<p><strong>History of Present Illness:</strong> Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 23 year old female with h/o SLE, lupus nephritis and ESRD on HD, and poorly controlled HTN on multiple medications presenting on [**8-25**] with unresponsiveness, bilateral lower extremity weakness, and nausea/vomiting. She was in her USOH until 2 days pta, when she developed n/v, and on the day of admission, she was found lying on the floor unresponsive to family members. Upon awakening she found that she could not move either of her legs. She was taken to the EW, where she had BP 260s/200s, had a non-contrast head CT showing left frontal ICH, right parieto-occipital ICH, and edema throughout bilaterally thought to be c/w PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) with superimposed ICH, and had a MRI/MRV to exclude venous thrombosis showing ICH in the parieto-occipital lobes bilaterally and pons without venous sinus thrombosis. She had a tonic-clonic seizure in the ED terminated with 2 mg IV lorazepam. Neurosurgery was consulted and felt that she should be managed non-surgically, a labetalol drip was started with a target SBP of 160s-180s, and she was admitted to the MICU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the MICU, she was initially maintained on the labetolol gtt. She was also started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. She was intubated to have an MRI of the head, as there was concern for sinus venous thrombosis. MRI was negative for thrombosis. She transiently required phenylepherine for BP maintenence while she was on a propofol gtt for maintenence of sedation. She was extubated on [**8-26**]. While in the ICU she was seen by nephrology who did not think she needed acute HD. Hematology was also consulted as the patient had thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. They did not think she had TTP and thought it was more likely [**Last Name (un) 1724**] from hypertensive emergency. Additionally, she had [**3-12**] sets of blood cultures from [**8-25**] grow oxacillan resistant coagulase negative staph and was started on vancomycin. TTE was done and negative for vegetation. Her PO BP meds were uptitrated in the ICU and SBPs have been &lt;180s in the past 24 hours. She was transferred to the Medicine Team.</p>
<p>Upon transfer to Medicine team, the patient's SBPs were being maintained between 150-160's and on po medications. She denied fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath.</p>

<p><strong>STUDIES:</strong> ========= CHEST (PORTABLE AP)</p>
<p>[**2140-8-25**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 11:49 a.m.: Tip of the new endotracheal tube, with the chin slightly flexed is no more than 15 mm above the carina, 2 cm below optimal placement, as reported to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 805**] by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2026**] on [**8-25**]. An ascending caval catheter ends in the low right atrium. Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Lungs are clear and heart size is normal. No pneumothorax.</p>
<p><strong>MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST [**2140-8-25**] IMPRESSION:</strong></p>
<p>1. Multifocal areas of cortical T2 signal hyperintensity, some with foci of recent hemorrhage. The most affected areas are the parietal and occipital lobes, as well as the pons. The appearance may represent posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Hemorrhage and pontine involvement in this disorder is somewhat unusual, but has been described in the literature.</p>
<p>2. No definite evidence of major venous sinus thrombosis. Nevertheless, if further evaluation is felt necessary clinically, axial and coronal-acquired 2D time-of-flight MR venography sequences could be performed, allowing each of the major venous sinuses to be imaged orthogonally, a procedure which would minimize any in-plane flow artifacts simulating thrombus. However, this diagnosis, even at present, is considered highly unlikely.</p>
<p><strong>CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2140-8-25**] IMPRESSION:</strong></p>
<p>1. Acute intraparenchymal hemorrhages peripherally in the right parietoccipital and left frontal lobes, with surrounding edema and local mass effect.</p>
<p>2. Vasogenic and interstitial edema in a strikingly symmetric and posterior distribution involving both [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter of the occipital lobes and frontalparietal regions, bilaterally.</p>
<p><strong>COMMENT:</strong></p>
<p><strong>These findings are highly suggestive of PRES (hypertensive encephalopathy)</strong>, with development of superimposed hypertensive hemorrhages. However, given the history of SLE, suspicion of underlying "lupus anticoagulant" and non-arterial distribution of edema and hemorrhage, cerebral venous (including dural venous sinus) thrombosis should be excluded, and urgent MRI with MRV has been recommended, below.</p>
<p>The results were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 698**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], EU resident, at the time of study.</p>
<p>2. Right maxillary sinus mucus retention cyst.</p>
<p><strong>CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) [**2140-8-25**] IMPRESSION:</strong> Unremarkable chest radiograph.</p>
<p><strong>EKG [**2140-8-25**]</strong> Sinus tachycardia. Voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities, most likely related to left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2140-7-30**] lateral ST-T wave abnormalities have improved. TRACING #1</p>
<p><strong>EKG [**2140-8-26**]</strong> Sinus tachycardia. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2140-8-25**] no significant diagnostic change. TRACING #2</p>
<p><strong>ECHO [**2140-8-26**]</strong> Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size. There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF&gt;75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The gradient increased with the Valsalva manuever. The findings are consistent with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.</p>
<p>Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-5-20**], no change.</p>
<p><strong>IMPRESSION:</strong> <strong>No valvular vegetations seen.</strong></p>
<p><br /> <strong>Brief Hospital Course: </strong></p>
<p>Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 23 yo female with a h/o SLE with secondary lupus nephritis, uveitis s/p left eye enucleation, question of APLS and poorly controlled HTN who presented on [**8-25**] with N/V, lethargy, fatigue and headaches, found to have hypertensive emergency,who subsequently seized. CT head showed multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages.</p>
<p># Hypertensive Emergency with ICH: Patient initially presented with significantly elevated blood pressures resulting in end organ damage causing seizure and intracranial hemorrhage. Her intracranial bleed appears to be most consistent with PRES, though septic emboli are on the differential. Goal SBP 150-160s. Continued dilantin 100 mg tid for seizure prophylaxis, and pt scheduled for follow up at neuro clinic in two weeks after discharge. Continued po regimen of labetolol 1000 mg TID, hydralazine 75 mg PO BID (the only change in home meds), lisinopril 40 mg [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 320 mg PO daily, nicardapine 60 mg PO TID, as well as clonidine patch when transferred to the floor. Pt achieved goal of SBPs in 150-160s on this regimen and was discharged home.</p>
<p># Bacteremia: She had high grade bacteremia with 6/6 bottles on [**8-25**] growing oxacillan resistant coagulase negative staph. HD cath was d/c'ed. A TTE was negative for vegetation. Blood cultures from [**8-27**] and [**8-28**] showed NGTD. Pt started on vancomycin. Levels were followed to achieve therapeutic goals. Ideally, vancomycin would be continued for 14 days after first negative blood cultures. Repeatedly, pt was told that vancomycin was superior to linezolid for bacteremia, but she still refused PICC. Thus, pt started on po linezolid and discharged with linezolid. She will need close follow up for bone marrow suppression secondary to linezolid.</p>
<p># Thrombocytopenia: Patient has had previous episodes of clinical illness with acute drop in platelets with question of consumptive coagulopathy from thrombosis vs. secondary to malignant hypertension. Received one unit platelets with placement of R femoral line. Platelets slowly improved over hospitalization. Evaluated by heme who did not think thrombocytopenia was consistent with TTP, but more likely to be due to malignant hypertension. Platelets counts improved with improvement in blood pressures.</p>
<p># SLE: The patient was previously treated with Cytoxan/Prednisone and on admission was on low dose prednisone. There had been concern in the past for anti-phospholipid syndrome but her APA testing has been negative. Rheum consulted. Pt on 15 mg prednisone during hospitalization and discharged with this dose and follow up.</p>
<p># CKD stage V - Patient most recently had not been to HD for 3 weeks because she did not like the way it made her feel. Some residual kidney function and awaiting kidney transplantation from a relative. HD catheter was pulled during this admission due to high grade bacteremia. Per renal, not imperative that pt needs acute HD. Electrolytes monitored. Sevelamer and daily Kayexalate continued during hospitalization.</p>
<p>#. Anemia - Thought to be chronic and likely related to her CKD. There was concern for hemolytic anemia during this admission, likely caused by malignant hypertension. Hct trended up during hospitalization. Continued Epogen 4000 u three times/wk per renal.</p>
