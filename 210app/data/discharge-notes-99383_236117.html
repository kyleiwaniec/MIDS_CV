<p><strong>History of Present Illness:</strong>
The patient is a 28 year old male with a history of alcohol
abuse who was recently discharged after an extended ICU
admission for pancreatits/hematemesis who during his hospital
stay had a cardiac arrest and subsequent anoxic brain injury
(see discharge summary). MRI showed diffuse anoxic injury, and
CT showed loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation.  He began
having seizure activity on [**2131-5-23**] and was treated with Keppra.
He also had an EEG that was nondiagnostic, and subsequent EEG
that showed seizures in the occipital lobe.  Keppra was
increased and seizures were controlled prior to d/c.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 3394**] was discharged to a rehab hospital where he was found
to have what was believed to be two siezures yesterday [**7-8**] and
one today with persistent eye deviation to the right.  He was
given ativan, after which tremors reportedly stopped, and then
transfer was arranged directly to the ICU.

Persistent lower lung volumes. Small to moderate left pleural
effusion is unchanged. Tracheostomy tube is in standard
position. Right PICC remains in place with tip in the upper SVC.
No evidence of pneumothorax. Bibasilar atelectasis are
unchanged. Cardiomediastinal contours are also stable NG tube
tip is in the stomach.
</p>

<p><strong>[**2131-7-18**] LENI:</strong></p>

1. No deep vein thrombosis in the right leg.
2. [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst in the right popliteal fossa which may have
ruptured or contains hemorrhage.

<p><strong>[**2131-7-16**] CT abdomen w/ and w/o contrast:</strong></p>

body, tail and head of the pancreas.
2. NEW - Nonocclusive thrombus in the superior mesenteric vein
extending to the junction of the splenic vein.
3. Interval enlargement of fluid collection lateral to the
antrum of the stomach.
4. Unchanged colonic wall thickening.

<p><strong>[**2131-7-16**] MRI head: </strong></p>No seizure focus identified. Diffuse volume
loss. Resolution of previously noted hypoxic changes in the
cortex. New changes in the pons and midbrain which could
represent a central pontine myelinolysis/osmotic demyelination.

<p><strong>EKG: </strong></p>Sinus tachycardia with nonspecific < 1mm ST depressions

<p><strong>[**7-17**] RUQ u/s-IMPRESSION:</strong></p>
1. No deep vein thrombosis in the right leg.
2. [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst in the right popliteal fossa which may have
ruptured or
contains hemorrhage.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


<p><strong>[**7-20**]-IMPRESSION: </strong></p>
No hemorrhage, mass, or fracture. Atrophy
likely secondary to global anoxic brain injury. Would recommend
MRI. Findings were discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1255**] [**Doctor Last Name 1256**] at 9:55 a.m. on
[**2131-7-20**].

<p><strong>[**7-24**] CTA abd-IMPRESSION:</strong></p>
1. No significant change in the appearance of numerous
pancreatic
pseudocysts, replacing the tail and distal pancreatic body, and
also adjacent
to the head of the pancreas and the gastric antrum. There are no
new intra-abdominal fluid collections identified. The residual
normal pancreatic tissue again demonstrates normal enhancement.
There is no evidence for new
inflammation involving this region. Peripancreatic stranding
persists.
2. Redemonstration of diffuse hepatic steatosis.
3. Minimal, if any, residual clot in the SMV. The SMV and
splenic vein as
well as the main portal vein, are patent, though a focal
narrowing of the
splenic vein is noted.
4. Unchanged colonic wall thickening, nonspecific.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


<p><strong>[**7-25**] EEGIMPRESSION: </strong></p>
This telemetry captured no pushbutton
activations. Routine
sampling continues to show poorly organized and low attenuation
background rhythm with frequent left occipital and posterior
temporal
discharges. Seizure detection files showed one electrographic
seizure.
There was no clinical correlate. Overall, this recording is
unchanged
compared to the previous 24 hours.


<p><strong>[**7-26**] EEG-IMPRESSION: </strong></p>
This telemetry captured no pushbutton
activations. Routine
sampling continues to show a poorly organized and low
attenuation
background. However, the left occipital discharges are less
frequent
and no runs were seen on routine sampling. Seizure detection
files
showed one possible electrographic seizure with right sided body

jerking. Overall, there are less seizures on this recording
compared to
the previous 24 hours.


<p><strong>[**8-9**] CXR:</strong></p>
The tracheostomy tip is 6.7 cm above the carina. The
right PICC line tip is
in the medial portion of right subclavian vein. There is no
change in the
high position of both hemidiaphragms and bibasilar atelectasis.
The
gastrostomy is projecting over its expected position in the left
upper
abdomen. No interval development of pneumothorax, pleural
effusion, or
pulmonary edema has been demonstrated.




<h3>Brief Hospital Course:</h3>
<p>
28 y/o male with an anoxic brain injury s/p cardiac arrest in
the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis [**2-5**] EtOH who was
recently d/c'd from [**Hospital1 18**] to rehab/LTC.  Was seen by a
neurologist at rehab after 2 seizures who in consultation with
Epileptology at [**Hospital1 18**] decided patient to be transfered back to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation to include neurology consult and
24hr EEG.
</p><p>
<strong>Seizure:</strong> Mr. [**Known lastname 3394**] has an anoxic brain injury and has had
seizures treated with keppra.  MRI and EEG results as above.
Transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurology eval and presumptive 24hr EEG.
 It is possible that these seizures are from benzo withdrawal
after the decrease in dose of the valium is possible but not
probable and more likely a result of his anoxic brain injury.
He remained on Neurology service who performed a 24 hr EEG and
Keppra was continued.  After development of WBC and fever he was
transfered to medicine but recieved several other EEGs including
24 hr EEG on [**2131-7-21**] which showed evidence of seizure activity.
He was followed by the neurology service and placed on keppra
and standing ativan. In addition, after witnessed TC seizures on
[**7-31**] he was loaded with dilantin and started on both PO and IV
regimens. His target dilantin levels were changed based on his
albumin levels.  Currently, pt's target levels are between [**7-15**].
Pt is currently on 200mg TID po dilantin. Intermittently, pt had
been given IV fosphenytoin for loading doses. Levels of dilantin
should be continually monitored and pt should be given 500mg po
dilantin as needed for when levels are below goal.  He should be
having levels two to three times a week for the first two weeks
or so to make sure he remains therapeutic.  His mental status
seems related to seizure activity..
</p><p><strong>Fevers/Tachypnea/Tachycardia: </strong> Pt has had persistent
fevers/tachypnea/tachycardia which were evaluated during the
prior hospitalization.  Multiple blood/urine Cx were initially
negative and the sputum Cx were thought to be colonization.
Eventually, pt grew multiple different colonies of pseudmonas
and ALCALIGENES, including cephalosporin resistant pseudomonas.
He was followed by the ID service and treated with tobramycin
and ceftazidime. This regimen will be completed on [**2131-8-14**]. In
addition, there is some question of whether pt had an allergic
rxn to meropenem, causing a blistering skin rash.  He is to
complete the above course.  If he clinically worsens, meropenem
could be considered, but likely should have another ID consult
due to the hx of a reaction.
</p><p><strong>PEA arrest: </strong>Occurred at 02:30 on [**7-20**].  Patient was noted by
housestaff to become increasingly bradycardic on tele. On
evaluation, pt found nonresponsive with no BP or pulse. Chest
compressions initiated for PEA arrest. Pt with agonal breathing
and suctioned by RT for copius secretions; respirations given
through ambu bag. He developed a rhythm concerning for Vfib; one
200J shock was delivered with subsequent rhythm of sinus
bradycardia. Femoral line placed. Pt given 1 amp epinephrine and
1 amp bicarb with increase in HR to 150 and BP 180/132. FSBS 21,
and pt received 1 amp D50. Duration of PEA arrest was 7 minutes.
Pt transferred to MICU for further management. VS on transfer:BP
94/64, HR 112, O2sat 99%.
- Unclear etiology. Mucous plugging likely given copious
secretions, especially since he has had PEA arrest in this
setting before (during hospitalization 6/[**2131**]). Possible
presepsis in setting of pneumonia given leukocytosis and low
grade temps. [**Month (only) 116**] have been complicated by AMS in setting of
hypoglycemia. Seizure with unwitnessed tonic clonic movements
also a possibility, perhaps triggered by hypoglycemia. PE less
likely with rapid recovery and as pt on heparin gtt, although
subtherapeutic.
</p><p><strong>Neuro eval post-code: </strong>Concern for herniation v. progression of
anoxic brain injury v. bleed given posturing, roving eye
movements, and weak corneal reflex in setting of hypertension to
SBP 230s. Does have seizure activity noted on EEG at admission
typified by RUE clonus and right gaze deviation which he did not
exhibit after the code.  His mental status slightly improved to
where he would occasionally nod his head yes/no to questions. He
appears to recognize his family.
</p><p><strong>Hypertension: </strong>Baseline SBP 110s-140s. After he received
epinephrine during the code was SBP sustained >200. [**Month (only) 116**] also be
related to clonic movements. Received hydral 10mg IV and started
on nitro gtt without effect. Subsequently received 2 doses of
ativan and hydralazine 20mg IV with improvement in SBP to 130.
AFter this point, his  blood pressure remained normotensive.
</p><p><strong>Hypoglycemia: </strong>FSG 90s-120s on stable dose of glargine. He had
iatrogenic hypoglycemia to 20, likely [**2-5**] continuation of
glargine while tube feeds discontinued, and this occured around
the time of the PEA arrest as described above.  Could be  also
decreased in setting of infection. FS now stable on the attached
regular insulin sliding scale.
</p><p><strong>Hypercalcemia:</strong> Unclear etiology, ?[**2-5**] bone turnover given low
PTH. Patient recieved aggressive IV fluids and endocrine consult
recommended calcitonin. He was also given IV bisphosphonate. His
calcium levels improved. In addition, he was started on vitamin
D.  He should continue vitamin D twice weekly for 4 weeks and
then have his level rechecked.
</p><p><strong>hyponatremia </strong>- Pt with persisent hyponatremia thought to likely
be related to SIADH from his neurologic issues and seizure
activity. His medications and tube feeds were concentrated, he
was placed on a fluid restriction. Urine electrolytes were
consistent with an SIADH pattern.  He did worsen with diuresis
and should be closely monitored if lasix started.
</p><p><strong>Volume Overload:</strong>  Pt was volume up during prior
hospitalization and was on dialysis [**2-5**] renal failure.  He has
had return of renal function and now is being diuresed with
lasix 40mg PO daily.  He is currently autodiuresing.
</p><p><strong>EtOH/Benzo withdrawal: </strong>Continued valium taper. Currently on
ativan q6h but for seizure ppx.  Also has been getting folic
acid/MVI/Thiamine which we will continue.
</p><p>Hypothyroidism - newly started on levothyroxine; should be
continued at current dose and have a TSH checked in about 1.5
weeks.
</p><p><strong>Weakness </strong>- should continue PT daily.
</p><p><strong>Pancreatitis </strong>- Patient has history of severe pancreatitis
complicated by known necrosis and pseudocytst.  Were worried
that he was having increasing pain and that it may have been the
source of his fevers before his VAP became apparent.  CT scan
was done showing no change, but surgery was reconsulted to see
if it was surgical.  He is not a candidate.  By the time of
discharge, his lipase was trending down and he had no apparent
pain and was tolerating tube feeds.
</p><p><strong>Nutrition </strong>- had PEG tube placed on [**8-9**], tolerating tube feeds
at the time of discharge.  Continue with concentrated TFs
secondary to hyponatremia.
</p><p><strong>SMV thrombus </strong>- patient had known SMV thrombus found
incidentally on CT scan during prior hospitalization.  Had been
anticoagulated on heparin gtt until we tried to bridge him with
coumadin.  Had difficulty maintaining therapeutic level and had
an interaction with dilantin.  Thought he would benefit best
from lovenox injections for the long run until more stabalized
on antiseizure medication.
