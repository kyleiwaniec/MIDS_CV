<p><strong>History of Present Illness:</strong> Initial H & P is as per the ICU team.
Patient is unable to give a full history, HPI taken from the
patients Father [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1683**], and ED resident:
</p><p>
Ms. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 38F with a PMH s/f type 1 Diabetes Mellitus with
prior episodes of DKA in the past, complicated by and NSTEMI in
[**8-/2111**], biventricular CHF, severe PVD s/p recent femoral bypass
for an ischemic right foot, and current cocaine abuse.  Last
night, her father noted her to have a decreased appetite, and
""changes in her body language"" consistent with past
presentations of hyperglycemia.  She went to sleep and woke up
at 3AM with extreme hunger.  At that time he checked a finger
stick, and noted it to be critically high.  He spoke to the
[**Last Name (un) **] coverage, who recommended administering her 75/25 and
sliding scale, and to continue monitoring.  When her finger
sticks and mental status did not change, he brought her to the
ED.  She has not had any fevers, chills, night sweats, URI
symptoms, vomiting, or diarrhea.  Her parents note severe pain
in both of her legs, which is chronic ""phantom limb pain"" and
neuropathy.  She had a dry cough this morning, but this is
chronic.
.<br>
On arrival to the ED she was afebrile, hypotensive with an SBP
of 88, HR=86, RR=18, O2 sat 100%.  She was A+Ox2, and complained
of left knee (phantom) pain.  Her exam was notable for dry
gangrene on her right foot.  Labs showed a blood sugar of 744, a
bicarbonate of 8, an anion gap of 30, ABG 7.12/30/106/10.  She
was given a 7 unit bolus of insulin, followed by 7units/hour
infusion, and a 2L NS bolus.  Labs were otherwise notable for a
creatinine of 3.5 (from a baseline of 1), flat cardiac enzymes,
leukocytosis to 19.8, thrombocytosis to 714, tox screen positive
for cocaine, and a contaminated UA.  CXR was clear, EKG is not
done, CT head pending, blood and urine cultures were sent.

CXR [**2112-4-3**]:

PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: The right IJ CV line
distal tip
projects in the right atrium and needs to be pulled by
approximately 3 cm. The mildly enlarged heart is stable. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The lungs are clear
with no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Right IJ line projects in the right atrium and
should be retracted by 3 cm for more optimal position.

EKG: Sinus rhythm @ 72bpm.  Modest ST-T wave changes are
nonspecific and baseline artifact makes assessment difficult.


<h3>Brief Hospital Course:</h3>
<p>
Ms. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right
femoral bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered
mental status secondary to DKA.
</p>
<p>Diabetic ketoacidosis:  The etiology of the patient's DKA was
thought to be medication noncompliance in the setting of
polysubstance abuse, as her tox screen was positive for cocaine
and she had no evidence of acute infection or cardiac ischemia.
A UA and CXR were nonfocal.  She was aggressively rehydrated
with normal saline, receiving approximately 6L in the ED and
overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Her respiratory status was followed
closely, given her history of bisystolic dysfunction.  She was
also initially managed with an insulin infusion at 5-6units/hr
(0.1units/kg/hr) until her blood sugar fell below 250 and her
anion gap closed, at which point she was started on an ISS.  Her
anion gap did widen to 17 on hospital day #2, [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted, and she was transitioned back to insulin gtt
overnight.  Then with closed gap, she was transitioned back to
[**Hospital1 **] nph 18 and 24.  Her finger stick glucose, lytes, and pH were
monitored closely, and potassium was repleted prn throughout her
ICU course.  Patient was transferred to floor on [**Hospital1 **] sq insulin,
with glucoses <150, and stable vital signs.  On the floor she
had some episodes of hypoglycemia (BS 40s).  The patient did not
eat as much as she should at meals because ""I don't like the
food here.""  Patient was given juice and crackers and blood
sugar returned to the normal range.  Her Humalog 75/25 was
reduced to her home dose of 15units qam and 20units qpm.  She
was instructed to follow up with [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient.
</p>
<p>
# Acute renal failure: Likely a result of profound dehydration,
as evidenced by BUN/Cr ratio >20 in the setting of DKA.  Her Cr
improved to 1.7 after intravascular volume repletion.  She was
also continued on nephrocaps and her medications were renally
dosed.
</p>
<p>Cocaine abuse: Urine tox screen is positive for cocaine,
prior OMR notes indicate that this is an ongoing problem.  [**Name (NI) **]
home regimen of metoprolol was held given the risk of unopposed
alpha agonism in setting of beta blockade.
</p>
<p>CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction:  Monitored
closely during volume resuscitation for signs of hypoxia.  Her
BB and lisinopril were held in the setting of hypotension and
ARF, but restarted before [**Name (NI) **].
</p>
<p>Chronic Pain: Her home regimen of oxycodone was held until
her mental status cleared.  It was resumed at [**Name (NI) **].
</p>
<p>Anxiety/depression:  Concintued clonazepam and lorazapam once
mental status cleared.
</p>
<p>Peripheral vascular disease:  The pt is s/p left BKA.  THe
patient had a recent bypass graft on the right and it was found
that to have gone down.  Vascular surgery was consulted.  Per
their note: ""There does not appear to be any acute
limb-threatening ischemia of the R foot.  There is no evidence
of RLE infection as the cause of her hyperglycemia or altered
mentalstatus.""  A follow up appointment was arranged with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1391**].
</p>
<p>
ACCESS: Access was difficult to obtain.  Pt needed RIJ placed.
