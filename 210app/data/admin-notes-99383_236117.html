<p><strong>Chief Complaint: &nbsp;Seizure</strong></p>
<p><strong>HPI:</strong> The patient is a 28 year old male with a history of alcohol<br /> abuse who was recently discharged after an extended ICU admission for<br /> pancreatits/hematemesis who during his hospital stay had a cardiac<br /> arrest and subsequent anoxic brain injury (see discharge summary). Mr.<br /> [**Known lastname 6420**] was discharged to a rehab hospital where today he was found to<br /> have what was believed to be a siezure with persistent eye deviation to<br /> the right. This was broken with valium, and then transfer was arranged<br /> directly to the ICU.</p>

<p><br /> <strong>Assessment and Plan</strong><br /> This is a 28y/o Male with an anoxic brain injury s/p cardiac arrest in<br /> the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis [**2-5**] EtOH who was recently d/c'd<br /> from [**Hospital1 5**] to rehab/LTC. Pt reportedly had two sz's yesterday and<br /> another this AM. Was seen by a neurologist at rehab who in<br /> consultation with Epileptology at [**Hospital1 5**] decided patient to be<br /> transfered back to [**Hospital1 5**] for further evaluation to include neurology<br /> consult and 24hr EEG.</p>
<p><br /><strong> <em>#Seizure: He underwent a head CT that</em></strong></p>
<p>demonstrated loss of [**Doctor Last Name 1359**]/white matter differentiation on</p>
<p>[**2131-5-23**]. On the same day, he also developed eye twitching concerning<br /> for seizure activity. Neurology was consulted and recommended starting<br /> keppra and hypertonic saline to treat his edema, which was thought to<br /> be secondary to both volume overload in the setting of IVFs and<br /> toxic-encephalopathy, likely secondary to elevated ammonia. His<br /> cerebral edema improved significantly over the next several days, as a<br /> follow-up head CT demonstrated significant improvement. He also<br /> underwent an EEG that was nondiagnostic for seizure activity. After<br /> several weeks he again was noted to have seizure-like activity with<br /> twitching of the mouth and eye deviation upward. He was initially<br /> thought to be withdrawing from benzodiazepines as this activity occured<br /> in the setting of weaning his midazolam gtt and he was treated with<br /> higher doses of benzos, which are being weaned with change of valium to<br /> 5mg qhs on [**2131-7-5**] with plan for 2wks at this dose before d/c'ing. After<br /> an EEG showed only seizures in the occipital lobe, his keppra dose was<br /> increased. He then underwent a repeat EEG that was negative for<br /> seizures. Upper extremity tremors thought more consistent with clonus<br /> and thought to be more reactive in setting of waking up. Not likely<br /> withdrawal from</p>
<p><br /> -Neurology c/s in AM w/ likely 24hr EEG<br /> -Cont. Keppra</p>
<p><strong>#Fevers/Tachypnea/Tachycardia:</strong> Pt has had persistent<br /> fevers/tachypnea/tachycardia which were evaluated during the prior<br /> hospitalization. Multiple blood/urine Cx were negative and the sputum<br /> Cx were thought to be colonization. The fevers/tachypnea/tachycardia<br /> were felt to be either central in origin or potentially from necrotic<br /> pancreatic tissue. Currently we are willing to tolerate this<br /> persistent state. If pt spikes high fever will investigate as<br /> appropriate.<br /> #Volume Overload: Pt was volume up during prior hospitalization and<br /> was on dialysis [**2-5**] renal failure. He has had return of renal function<br /> and now is being diuresed with lasix 40mg PO daily.<br /> -Continue lasix 40mg PO/NG daily<br /> #EtOH/Benzo withdrawal: Continue to taper of valium. Currently at 5mg<br /> PO qhs. Also has been getting folic acid/MVI/Thiamine which we will<br /> continue.</p>
