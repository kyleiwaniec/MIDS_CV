<p>
Patient is a 65 year-old right handed man who presented
to the emergency room at [**Hospital1 18**] after the sudden onset of
headache, nausea and 3 episodes of vomiting as well as double
vision. He states that he was in his usual state of health this
afternoon and had been working out (mostly weight-lifting, with
some cardiovascular exercise as well) His wife says that he was
working out for the first time in 6 months and was really
pushing himself. Around 8:30 pm he was sitting and watching
television when he noticed that he had sudden onset of double
vision which he also reported as being blurred and felt a
bifrontal squeezing headache. He became acutely nauseous and
vomitied 3 times. When his wife looked at him she noticed that
his right eye was deviated out to the right and that he was
unable to move his eyes. EMTs were called and in the field they
noted that his blood pressure was in the 270s systolic. He was
given 10 mg of Labetolol and when he arrived at he was in the 230s systolic. A
code stroke was called.<p>

<p><strong>EKG on [**6-30**]:</strong><br>
Sinus rhythm. Consider left ventricular hypertrophy
by voltage. Prior inferior myocardial infarction. Borderline

<li>No acute intracranial abnormality and no significant change
since the [**8-8**] NECT.
<li>No evidence of vascular territorial infarct or ischemia on
the CT-perfusion study.
<li>Evidence of disconjugate gaze, new since the [**8-8**] study.

<h3>Brief Hospital Course:</h3>
<p><strong>NEURO:</strong><p>
<p>  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year-old right handed man who presented to
the ED as a code stroke for blurred and double vision as well as
episodes of headaches, nausea and vomiting (x3) yesterday
afternoon. Reportedly, BP in the field was 270s systolic.  He
received 10 mg of labetolol in the field and his SBP was 230
when he got to the ED. His exam in the ED was consistent with a
one-and-a-half syndrome in which he had almost complete
paralysis of the left eye and had abduction of the right eye
with impaired adduction. There was also impaired upgaze and
vertical nystagmus with a rotatory component on downgaze.
Although he arrived as code stroke, given the NIHSS of 1 for
gaze limitation, tPA was not administered. CTA and perfusion
showed no perfusion deficits and no vascular occlusions. The
likely etiology is small vessel disease of pontine perforating
arteries.  An MRI was done  and it showed a small DWI lesion in
the posterior superior pons regions. He was initially admitted
to the ICU for BP monitoring.  He initially required IV
labetalol but his SBP was consistently < 190 with oral meds only
and he was transferred to the floor the next morning. He was
initially continued to ASA and [**Known lastname **] for secondary stroke
prevention.  Given the new stroke despite of the [**Known lastname **] and ASA,
genetic testing of CYP2C19 was sent during this admission to
assess for possible [**Known lastname **] failure; this showed that he is
insensitive to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this was stopped and he was continued
on only Aspirin (after discussion with his vascular surgeon).
His LDL was 65 during this admission.  His HbA1C was found to be
6.5%.  Echocardiogram to assess for possible proximal clot and
to look PFO/ASD was negative.<p>
<p>  While on the floor, he developed acute difficulty swallowing;
he had STAT CT and CTA performed, which showed no new lesions.
He was transferred to the step-down unit for closer monitoring.
He did not tolerate NG placement so plan was for PEG. He was
made NPO for PEG, but his BP was not well controlled without his
meds and so while he was waiting for PEG placement, he was
transferred to the ICU for BP control- he was placed on
Nicardipine gtt with good effect and was transferred back to the
step down unit after the PEG was placed and he was able to get
oral medications via PEG. He did have a repeat MRI, which did
show a new region of acute infarction in the left inferior
cerebellar peduncle without hemorrhage as well as extenstion of
the left paramedian pons infarction anteriorly. Of note, he did
develop new onset ataxia, left greater than right, corresponding
with the new stroke that was noted.<p>
<p>  While on the floor, he became delirious and pulled out his PEG
tube. While awaiting IR replacement of tube, his condition
deteriorated and he became more delirious, agitated and began
spiking high grade fevers up to 103. He was emergently taken to
the OR by the surgery team (further info below in GI section).
Upon return to floor, he was neurologically stable and was again
alert and oriented with good cognition. His BPs were also under
control on current regimen. If his BPs do increase at rehab or
in future, HCTZ should be started as he was on this prior to OR,
but BPs have been controlled since while off this medication. He
was up to a dose of HCTZ 50 mg daily so this can be titrated up
to this dose if necessary. Just of note, due to his
long-standing hx of HTN- he had a renal ultrasound to assess for
evidence of renal artery stenosis; there was no clear evidence
of this based on the study.<p>

<p>OPTHO: Due to the ataxia of his left arm, he accidentally
scratched his left eye with resulting corneal abrasion.
Opthamology was consulted and followed the patient closely. They
have also noted that he was having dry eyes. On day of dicahrge,
his vision improved to OD 20/30 and OS 20/100. He is to continue
on Lacrilube ointment- right eye  [**Hospital1 **] + QHS and left eye QID and
QHS. For diplopia, they note that his glasses could be tape but
pirate patches should be avoided at this time. He will f/u with
[**Hospital1 **] eye clinic on Monday [**7-21**].<p>

<p>GI: Failed swallow eval and had PEG placed. As mentioned above,
in setting of delirium, he pulled out his PEG tube with
subsequent worsening of condition while awaiting replacement of
tube in IR. He was emergently taken to OR, with post-op
diagnosis of torn gastrostomy. The OR procedure included
Exploratory laparotomy with partial gastrectomy and replacement
of gastric tube and Irrigation and debridement of abdominal wall
abscess. He received a 3 day course of Fluconazole and should
complete a 7 day course of Flagyl, Vanco and Zoysn (the final
day is [**2183-7-22**]). He should have [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes and staples
are to be removed on [**2183-7-21**]. His G-tube is now able to be used.<p>


<p>ENDO: was maintained on SSI in the hospital for his DMII. At
time of discharge, he is being restarted on his home regimen.
FSGs should continue to be checked with SSI used as necessary
for goal of euglycemia.<p>

<h3>Discharge Instructions:</h3>
<p>  You presented with blurry vision and headache with nausea and
vomiting and was found to have a stroke in the left part of the
brainstem called the pons and later also found to have a second
stroke in the part of the brain called the left inferior
cerebellar peduncle. The first stroke resulted in the limited
eye movements and the second resulted in the difficulty to
control the movement of your arms. The strokes are thought to be
secondary to small vessel disease. You were continued on Aspirin
and [**Location (un) **] for stroke protection, but you were later found to be
insensitive to [**Location (un) **] based on blood tests, so this was stopped
and you were just continued on Aspirin. Your stroke risk factors
were checked.  You should continue to abstain from smoking.
Your BP needs to be well controlled; you are on numerous BP meds
now, which you need to continue to take. Your cholesterol was
65. Your statin was increased to 40mg daily.  You had a cardiac
echocardiogram which demonstrated no cardioembolic source and no
evidence of PFO or ASD. You were checked for blood glucose
control with a HbA1c. The level was 6.3%. At discharge, you were
restarted on your home hypoglycemic regimen.<p>
<p>  You developed abrasions of your left eye after accidentally
hitting it while your arms were difficult to control from your
stroke. You were seen by the Opthamology Service, who thought
you had corneal abrasions in the left eye and started you on
lubricating drops as well as made recommendations for closure of
the eye at night. You should continue to follow with Opthamology
in clinic; an appointment has already been made for Monday<p>
<p>  You had a PEG tube placed for feeds and medications because
you were having difficulty swallowing. This got pulled out one
night during a period of delirium and resulted in the
development of an infection, for which you went to the OR and
was started on antibiotics. You will continue these anitibiotics
in rehab to complete a 7 day course.<p>
